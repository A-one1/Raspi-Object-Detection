# Raspi-Object-Detection
▪ Built a multi-purpose remote control car for object detection using Raspberry Pi 3 and arduino which can be
controlled remotely or automatically using built-in motor and sensors to avoid obstacles
▪ Implemented real-time object detection using OpenCV and a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model using Raspberry
Pi 3 to analyze the data and show confidence score.
▪ Integrated various hardware components with an Arduino to control the functionality of the car by developing
custom code to interface with the sensors and motor.
